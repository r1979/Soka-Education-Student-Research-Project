Through ethnographic analysis of the two courses titled ÒEl Hombre y los Juegos,Ó conducted through La Pontificia Universidad Cat—lica de Valparaiso, this paper aims to better understand how pedagogies of experience may be incorporated to improve education today. Comparison of the findings with the curriculum from the Anti-Defamation League is used to better understand how experience can be reflected upon for educative purposes in educational settings. The participants of the study are the two professors of the course. Interviews with students from the courses were utilized to corroborate or contradict the information provided by the subjects. Detailed individual interviews, conducted in Spanish, were the main technique that was used to collect information for this research and were done in-person using a tape recorder; all quotes from these interviews derive from translation by the investigator. Closure for interviews with the two subjects was directed by saturation criteria. Observation of one of the parallels was also used to accompany the interviews. To provide a format for the paper, the results are presented using the process outlined in David A. Kolb_s ÒExperiential Learning CycleÓ (1984). The four elements of the cycle are Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation. In Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation, three categorical elements are expounded to distinguish the course and pedagogies of experience: Individual or Communal experience; Control of the Objective Conditions and Desired Outcomes; and the Dynamics of the Reconstruction of said experience(s). Under Abstract Conceptualization, the paper discusses how structured experiences are encounters that develop intra-personal awareness and interpersonal relations. The Active Experimentation stage concludes with postulations on how pedagogies of experience could be used to further facilitate participants_ confrontation of their lives and a proposal to re-imagine programs such as this one as a form of therapy for individuals and communities.",pg. 7-16,2011,Menelik Tafari,2013-12-01 01:11:11,el-hombre-juegos-and-pedagogies-of-experience,lkbgift,paperCan Active Citizenship Be Learned?,,"This paper will discuss some relevant issues in relation to citizenship education, learning from the examples of two Asian dissidents of the 21st century, ideology of Makiguchi and Gandhi who opposed the authoritarianism of their own governments – in Japan and India respectively. I selected the examples of these two thinkers also because they were influenced by both the east and of the west, and because their ideas are being used within the education and politics of their respective countries today. Makiguchi was an educator but today his ideas have influenced the politics of Japan. On the other hand, Gandhi, who is better known than Makiguchi, was a political leader, but he had also developed his own indigenous views on education like Makiguchi.",pg. 20-23,2011,Dr. Namrata Sharma,2013-12-01 01:11:11,can-active-citizenship-be-learned,lkbgift,paperAn Overview of the Editions of Soka Kyouikugaku Taikei,,"This paper will try to give a coherent exposition of the different editions of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi’s work on the educational philosophy of Soka education. With only very few English works available on Makiguchi, one might think this is quickly done, but this panel – consisting of Gonzalo Obelleiro’s paper, “Challenges and Possibilities for Soka education Research in Translation,” Nozomi Inukai’s paper, “Soka Kyouikugaku Taikei and Education for Creative Living: How Makiguchi’s Educational Ideas are Presented in English,” and my own – shall show that the contrary is the case. Ironically, I am in a very poor position to present a critical evaluation of the odd circumstances surrounding the different editions of Makiguchi’s work as I am not fluent in the Japanese language. My investigation is therefore based on a critical reading of the English sources, on support from Nozomi Inukai and on the expertise of Takao Ito, lecturer of philosophy at Soka University in Tokyo. Should any content of the present investigation be mistaken or misunderstood, my sources should not be blamed; I alone hold the responsibility and I will continue my investigation to produce the clearest possible picture of Makiguchi’s publishing activities and its ensuing history.",pg. 24-29,2011,Simon Hoffding,2013-12-01 01:11:11,an-overview-of-the-editions-of-soka-kyouikugaku-taikei,lkbgift,paperSoka Kyouikugaku Taikei and Education for Creative Living: How Makiguchi's Educational Ideas are Presented in English,,"Tsunesaburo Makiguchi_s Soka Kyoikugaku Taikei (lit. System of Value-Creating Pedagogy) was first published in 1930-1934 by Fuzanbo publishing company. Since then, multiple editions have been published. The reprint of the original copy was published in 1979 by Daisan Bunmeisha, and this is also contained in Makiguchi Zenshu (lit. completed works of Makiguchi) Volume 5 and 6 published by Daisan Bunmeisha in 1982-1983. In 1972-1980, Seikyo Shinbunsha published a new edition which changed some parts into modern kanji and pronunciation of kanji (vol.1, p. 3). The English translation of Makiguchi_s pedagogy was published as Education for Creative Living in 1989 with Alfred Birnbaum as the translator and Dayle M. Bethel as the editor. To this day, this is the only existing English edition of Makiguchi_s Soka Kyoikugaku Taikei. Education for Creative Living has greatly contributed to introducing Makiguchi_s educational ideas to the non-Japanese-speaking world. It even served as the basis for translations into thirteen languages and has inspired creative educational efforts in India and Brazil (Goulah & Gebert, 2009, p. 118). However, it is not a full translation of the 4-volume Soka Kyoikugaku Taikei. According to Goulah and Gebert (2009), Bethel_s work is “selectively edited, revised and, in places, liberally translated” (p. 118).",pg. 30-43,2011,Nozomi Inukai,2013-12-01 01:11:11,soka-kyouikugaku-taikei-and-education-for-creative-living-how-makiguchis-educational-ideas-are-presented-in-english,lkbgift,paperChallenges and Possibilities for Soka Education Research in Translation,,"For research in some of the disciplines mentioned above, limited availability of English translations of works by Makiguchi and of significant secondary literature by Japanese scholars poses significant obstacles. Archival research is clearly impossible without access to the original sources. Even the prospects of development in the foundational areas of philosophy of education and the history of ideas are bleak within the available sources in English translation. Naturally, command of the original language is a reasonable expectation for a professional scholar. However, until the problem of reliable translations availability is overcome, the ability of scholars to broadly engage the ideas of value-creating pedagogy in their professional communities remains seriously hampered.",pg. 44-52,2011,Gonzalo Obelleiro,2013-12-01 01:11:11,challenges-and-possibilities-for-soka-education-research-in-translation,lkbgift,paper"Conditions of Creativity: A Reading of Descartes, Kant, and Leibniz in the Context of Soka Education",,"The term “Soka” in “Soka education,” in Japanese, means “to create value” or “value-creating.” In Education for Creative Living, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi in great detail expounds on the meaning of “value,” but only twice mentions what is meant by “creating” (1989:50, 56-7). Behind the verb “to create” lies the noun “creation” or “creativity;” in order to create anything, one must be creative, one must possess creativity. The aim of the present paper is therefore to answer the question: what are the conditions of creativity? I shall separate the answer into an epistemological part and an ontological ditto. In the first part, which will comprise the bulk of the paper, I shall use the philosophical systems and starting-points of Descartes, Kant and Leibniz in addition to a critical review of more recent and mostly psychological literature on the area. The second part is a tentative introduction to the Buddhist notion of “Ku” (_ or__) meaning emptiness or potential, as expounded by Daisaku Ikeda. And it is through Daisaku Ikeda_s central idea of “Human Revolution” that the analysis shall come full circle, by a demonstration of some curricular initiatives that could increase creativity in education.",pg. 53-62,2011,Simon Hoffding,2013-12-01 01:11:11,conditions-of-creativity-a-reading-of-descartes-kant-and-leibniz-in-the-context-of-soka-education,lkbgift,paperEducation in Rural El Salvador: Looking at Rural Development through Soka Education,,"In the summer of 2010, I spent three months in Estancia, El Salvador, implementing an art education program with youth aged 8-16 when I had this experience in their local classroom. The program consisted of weekly meetings with four different youth groups. We met after school for two hours where we used drawing and painting projects to critically reflect on their community and experience. The people of Estancia live almost entirely on subsistence farming, and their access to information is limited due to the absence of electricity while there, I began to ask myself, how could Tsunesaburo Makiguchi’s Soka education pedagogy benefit the development of rural, impoverished communities like Estancia?",pg. 63-68,2011,Garrett Braun,2013-12-01 01:11:11,education-in-rural-el-salvador-looking-at-rural-development-through-soka-education,lkbgift,paper"Academic Sovereignty, Technology, and Soka Education: From a Culture of War towards a Culture of Peace",,"After briefly discussing the history of Soka education and Makiguchi_s call for academic sovereignty, the first part of paper will be about universities that have surrendered their intellectual independence by signing contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD) to do military research. I will also explore the ways that the DoD has utilized technology, education, and the media to support a culture of war. In part two, there will be a discussion of technology_s rapid pace of growth to show how the tools of the future are becoming much more powerful and how the stakes of this problem are becoming much higher. This also shows how imperative it is to create an educational system that helps students undergo an inner transformation, so that they can develop the wisdom to use these tools. In part three, I will offer three proposals that will explore ways that we can do this. To conclude, I will argue that because education has this ability to foster self-transformation and empowerment, we must undergo a dramatic shift of perspective to place education as the ultimate goal of all social endeavors.",pg. 69-78,2011,Ryan Hayashi,2013-12-01 01:11:11,academic-sovereignty-technology-and-soka-education-from-a-culture-of-war-towards-a-culture-of-peace,lkbgift,paperScience Education for Value Creation,,"Science and technology have provided the foundation of our modern industrialized society and are thus an integral part of the daily lives of all people. The scientific worldview is an integral part of society, no longer partitioned off as a discipline contained only in academia. With the 21st century_s advent into the digital renaissance and the acculturation of science into every strata of society, the laymen and the scientists are in need of science education which is relevant to the world they collectively engage. There is a need for science to have an aim of social utility, and thus it is essential for scientific education to be grounded in society and taught in relation to the humanities and other disciplines. Scientific education should emphasize to students the relationship between scientific inquiry and society. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the theoretical framework of Soka education, provided by Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Daisaku Ikeda, can contribute to constructing a holistic science education.",pg. 79-83,2011,Tyko Shoji and Scott Williams,2013-12-01 01:11:11,science-education-for-value-creation,lkbgift,paperSoka Journalism Education: On Value Creative Subjectivity,,"Like Zeus’s undisturbed reign over Olympus, objectivity, as American journalism’s moral compass, once reigned high. Whether the ethic of objectivity first took root during the Jacksonian Revolution of the 1830s or during the Progressive Era of the 20th century is debated, however, it came to be considered an important tool for successful democracy as it “supposedly secured a space for neutral, factual information and public deliberation outside the corruption, rancor, and partisan spin that normally characterizes public discourse” (Kaplan 25). In 1923, the American Society of Newspaper Editors directly equated ethical journalism to objective journalism. (Kitty 2) For the unfortunate reason that objective pieces are inexpensive, while interpretative, investigative journalism is expensive and time consuming, “ethical objectivity” continues to be a standard for journalism today. When profit is the driving force, interpretative journalism is not favorable; in the words of Philip Meyer, it “requires a level of skill not much in demand from a system that conceives of news media as mere platforms for attracting eyeballs to ads.”",pg. 84-89,2011,Jihii Jolly,2013-12-01 01:11:11,soka-journalism-education-on-value-creative-subjectivity,lkbgift,paperExploring the Narrative Approach,,"In the context of Soka education research, while there is much to learn from quantitative methods, there are other aspects about Soka education where quantitative methods are limited.

By instilling positive ideals in children at a young age, we hope they will eventually go out in the world and make a major change.

Modifications of nature that human beings made in the past two centuries are noticeably catastrophic. The situation has reached the point where solutions can no longer be forgone. In the history of Soka education (education for value-creating life), environmental education has not been the center of discussion; however, Soka education is concerned with environmental issues. The founder of the Soka schools and a Japanese peace activist, Daisaku Ikeda, has mentioned environmental crises and education as a challenge to humankind and has emphasized the importance of environmental education in the modern age. I conducted my case study at Rio Muchacho community school in rural Ecuador in order to examine Soka education’s contribution to the local environmental situation. Without knowing Soka education, the community school has adopted educational practices and philosophy that are remarkably similar to what Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, the founder of Soka education, proposed. On one hand, installation of the half-day school system has succeeded in fostering local leaders in sustainable agriculture. On the other hand, the curriculum is too locally focused and limits student’s potential. With a deeper and more inclusive understanding of Soka education, the community school could become a grassroots movement that contributes to sustainable development on a global scale.",pg. 130-139,2011,Yui Takishima,2013-12-01 01:11:11,from-local-to-global-soka-educations-potential-for-sustainable-development-in-ecuador-and-beyond,lkbgift,paperEnvironmental Department: An Example of Soka Education at SUA,,"Through learning, reflecting, and empowering, Soka education encourages an intellectual understanding of society and instills substantial changes in people’s actions, starting from their communities.

Their common characteristics lay a definitive foundation for the beginning of a truly humanistic education for transformation towards the happiness of the individual and manifestation of holistic social well-being. By both emphasizing the profound importance of the role of the educator in helping students to bring forth their personal experience as the backdrop for educational practice, they create an environment that fosters mutual recognition, creativity, and empowerment which can ultimately lead to social consciousness for concrete action. Hip hop has become such a unique art form because its roots in resistance seek to empower those who are oppressed, rather than only allow their art to express lamentation or passive anger. By developing hip hop into a pedagogical practice based on its integrated foundations in popular and resistive cultural movements, it can help students understand their multicultural context and provide an empowering avenue through which to incite social change and work for this development of a truly democratic and participatory environment.",pg. 158-168,2011,Simone Barclay and Ryan Hayashi (Hip Hop Congress),2013-12-01 01:11:11,education-for-social-consciousness-hip-hop-pedagogy-and-soka-education,lkbgift,paperA Value-Creating Conception of Appreciation,,"Over the years, we have been engaging in an ongoing conversation about a few important topics related to the theory and practice of Soka education.
