Their common characteristics lay a definitive foundation for the beginning of a truly humanistic education for transformation towards the happiness of the individual and manifestation of holistic social well-being. By both emphasizing the profound importance of the role of the educator in helping students to bring forth their personal experience as the backdrop for educational practice, they create an environment that fosters mutual recognition, creativity, and empowerment which can ultimately lead to social consciousness for concrete action. Hip hop has become such a unique art form because its roots in resistance seek to empower those who are oppressed, rather than only allow their art to express lamentation or passive anger. By developing hip hop into a pedagogical practice based on its integrated foundations in popular and resistive cultural movements, it can help students understand their multicultural context and provide an empowering avenue through which to incite social change and work for this development of a truly democratic and participatory environment.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-<wbr \/>content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/<wbr \/>conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf<\/a><\/p>"],"published_pages":["pg. 158-168"]},"taxonomy_published_issue":[{"id":15,"slug":"2011","title":"2011","description":"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf","post_count":19}],"taxonomy_authors":[{"id":31,"slug":"simone-barclay-and-ryan-hayashi-hip-hop-congress","title":"Simone Barclay and Ryan Hayashi (Hip Hop Congress)","description":"","post_count":1}]},{"id":90,"type":"paper","slug":"the-power-of-failure-an-odyssey-into-the-meaning-of-success","url":"http:\/\/sesrp.atriangle.com\/paper\/the-power-of-failure-an-odyssey-into-the-meaning-of-success\/","status":"publish","title":"The Power of Failure: An Odyssey into the Meaning of Success","title_plain":"The Power of Failure: An Odyssey into the Meaning of Success","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2013-12-01 01:11:11","modified":"2014-02-15 09:45:18","categories":[],"tags":[],"author":{"id":2,"slug":"lkbgift","name":"lkbgift","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"lkbgift","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"open","custom_fields":{"paper_abstract":["<p>So in fewer and less confusing words success and failure are actually matters of control and freedom, and, as in any dichotomy, present challenges within their encounter rather than in their direct differences.

There is a need for science to have an aim of social utility, and thus it is essential for scientific education to be grounded in society and taught in relation to the humanities and other disciplines. Scientific education should emphasize to students the relationship between scientific inquiry and society. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the theoretical framework of Soka education, provided by Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Daisaku Ikeda, can contribute to constructing a holistic science education.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-<wbr \/>content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/<wbr \/>conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf<\/a><\/p>"],"published_pages":["pg. 79-83"]},"taxonomy_published_issue":[{"id":15,"slug":"2011","title":"2011","description":"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf","post_count":19}],"taxonomy_authors":[{"id":23,"slug":"tyko-shoji-and-scott-williams","title":"Tyko Shoji and Scott Williams","description":"","post_count":1}]},{"id":81,"type":"paper","slug":"academic-sovereignty-technology-and-soka-education-from-a-culture-of-war-towards-a-culture-of-peace","url":"http:\/\/sesrp.atriangle.com\/paper\/academic-sovereignty-technology-and-soka-education-from-a-culture-of-war-towards-a-culture-of-peace\/","status":"publish","title":"Academic Sovereignty, Technology, and Soka Education: From a Culture of War towards a Culture of Peace","title_plain":"Academic Sovereignty, Technology, and Soka Education: From a Culture of War towards a Culture of Peace","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2013-12-01 01:11:11","modified":"2014-02-15 09:43:30","categories":[],"tags":[],"author":{"id":2,"slug":"lkbgift","name":"lkbgift","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"lkbgift","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"open","custom_fields":{"paper_abstract":["<p>After briefly discussing the history of Soka education and Makiguchi_s call for academic sovereignty, the first part of paper will be about universities that have surrendered their intellectual independence by signing contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD) to do military research. I will also explore the ways that the DoD has utilized technology, education, and the media to support a culture of war. In part two, there will be a discussion of technology_s rapid pace of growth to show how the tools of the future are becoming much more powerful and how the stakes of this problem are becoming much higher. This also shows how imperative it is to create an educational system that helps students undergo an inner transformation, so that they can develop the wisdom to use these tools. In part three, I will offer three proposals that will explore ways that we can do this. To conclude, I will argue that because education has this ability to foster self-transformation and empowerment, we must undergo a dramatic shift of perspective to place education as the ultimate goal of all social endeavors.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-<wbr \/>content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/<wbr \/>conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf<\/a><\/p>"],"published_pages":["pg. 69-78"]},"taxonomy_published_issue":[{"id":15,"slug":"2011","title":"2011","description":"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf","post_count":19}],"taxonomy_authors":[{"id":22,"slug":"ryan-hayashi","title":"Ryan Hayashi","description":"","post_count":3}]},{"id":80,"type":"paper","slug":"education-in-rural-el-salvador-looking-at-rural-development-through-soka-education","url":"http:\/\/sesrp.atriangle.com\/paper\/education-in-rural-el-salvador-looking-at-rural-development-through-soka-education\/","status":"publish","title":"Education in Rural El Salvador: Looking at Rural Development through Soka Education","title_plain":"Education in Rural El Salvador: Looking at Rural Development through Soka Education","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2013-12-01 01:11:11","modified":"2014-02-15 09:45:04","categories":[],"tags":[],"author":{"id":2,"slug":"lkbgift","name":"lkbgift","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"lkbgift","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"open","custom_fields":{"paper_abstract":["<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-<wbr \/>content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/<wbr \/>conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf<\/a><\/p>"],"published_pages":["pg. 63-68"]},"taxonomy_published_issue":[{"id":15,"slug":"2011","title":"2011","description":"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf","post_count":19}],"taxonomy_authors":[{"id":21,"slug":"garrett-braun","title":"Garrett Braun","description":"","post_count":1}]},{"id":79,"type":"paper","slug":"conditions-of-creativity-a-reading-of-descartes-kant-and-leibniz-in-the-context-of-soka-education","url":"http:\/\/sesrp.atriangle.com\/paper\/conditions-of-creativity-a-reading-of-descartes-kant-and-leibniz-in-the-context-of-soka-education\/","status":"publish","title":"Conditions of Creativity: A Reading of Descartes, Kant, and Leibniz in the Context of Soka Education","title_plain":"Conditions of Creativity: A Reading of Descartes, Kant, and Leibniz in the Context of Soka Education","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2013-12-01 01:11:11","modified":"2014-02-15 09:45:53","categories":[],"tags":[],"author":{"id":2,"slug":"lkbgift","name":"lkbgift","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"lkbgift","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"open","custom_fields":{"paper_abstract":["<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-<wbr \/>content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/<wbr \/>conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf<\/a><\/p>"],"published_pages":["pg. 53-62"]},"taxonomy_published_issue":[{"id":15,"slug":"2011","title":"2011","description":"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf","post_count":19}],"taxonomy_authors":[{"id":18,"slug":"simon-hoffding","title":"Simon Hoffding","description":"","post_count":2}]},{"id":78,"type":"paper","slug":"challenges-and-possibilities-for-soka-education-research-in-translation","url":"http:\/\/sesrp.atriangle.com\/paper\/challenges-and-possibilities-for-soka-education-research-in-translation\/","status":"publish","title":"Challenges and Possibilities for Soka Education Research in Translation","title_plain":"Challenges and Possibilities for Soka Education Research in Translation","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2013-12-01 01:11:11","modified":"2014-02-15 09:46:28","categories":[],"tags":[],"author":{"id":2,"slug":"lkbgift","name":"lkbgift","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"lkbgift","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"open","custom_fields":{"paper_abstract":["<p>For research in some of the disciplines mentioned above, limited availability of English translations of works by Makiguchi and of significant secondary literature by Japanese scholars poses significant obstacles.

System of Value-Creating Pedagogy) was first published in 1930-1934 by Fuzanbo publishing company. Since then, multiple editions have been published. The reprint of the original copy was published in 1979 by Daisan Bunmeisha, and this is also contained in Makiguchi Zenshu (lit. completed works of Makiguchi) Volume 5 and 6 published by Daisan Bunmeisha in 1982-1983. In 1972-1980, Seikyo Shinbunsha published a new edition which changed some parts into modern kanji and pronunciation of kanji (vol.1, p. 3). The English translation of Makiguchi_s pedagogy was published as Education for Creative Living in 1989 with Alfred Birnbaum as the translator and Dayle M. Bethel as the editor. To this day, this is the only existing English edition of Makiguchi_s Soka Kyoikugaku Taikei. Education for Creative Living has greatly contributed to introducing Makiguchi_s educational ideas to the non-Japanese-speaking world. It even served as the basis for translations into thirteen languages and has inspired creative educational efforts in India and Brazil (Goulah &amp; Gebert, 2009, p. 118).

Through ethnographic analysis of the two courses titled El Hombre y los Juegos, conducted through La Pontificia Universidad Cat\u2014lica de Valparaiso, this paper aims to better understand how pedagogies of experience may be incorporated to improve education today. Comparison of the findings with the curriculum from the Anti-Defamation League is used to better understand how experience can be reflected upon for educative purposes in educational settings. The participants of the study are the two professors of the course. Interviews with students from the courses were utilized to corroborate or contradict the information provided by the subjects. Detailed individual interviews, conducted in Spanish, were the main technique that was used to collect information for this research and were done in-person using a tape recorder; all quotes from these interviews derive from translation by the investigator. Closure for interviews with the two subjects was directed by saturation criteria. Observation of one of the parallels was also used to accompany the interviews. To provide a format for the paper, the results are presented using the process outlined in David A. Kolb' s Experiential Learning Cycle (1984). The four elements of the cycle are Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation. In Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation, three categorical elements are expounded to distinguish the course and pedagogies of experience: Individual or Communal experience; Control of the Objective Conditions and Desired Outcomes; and the Dynamics of the Reconstruction of said experience(s). Under Abstract Conceptualization, the paper discusses how structured experiences are encounters that develop intra-personal awareness and interpersonal relations. The Active Experimentation stage concludes with postulations on how pedagogies of experience could be used to further facilitate participants' confrontation of their lives and a proposal to re-imagine programs such as this one as a form of therapy for individuals and communities.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-<wbr \/>content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/<wbr \/>conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf<\/a><\/p>"],"published_pages":["pg. 7-16"]},"taxonomy_published_issue":[{"id":15,"slug":"2011","title":"2011","description":"http:\/\/www.sesrp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/conferenceboklet2011-again.pdf","post_count":19}],"taxonomy_authors":[{"id":16,"slug":"menelik-tafari","title":"Menelik Tafari","description":"","post_count":2}]}],"query":{"ignore_sticky_posts":true,"post_type":"paper"}}
